## Budget

This project is a result of a 3 months online programming I participated in.

- This Budget App which is the final project, involve the process of calculating an organisation budgets utilization by visualing reporting the net income and revenue for a particular period.

It is really a big project.

All files attached, it's open source and you all can learn from it or use it as inspiration for your future projects.

Thanks.
